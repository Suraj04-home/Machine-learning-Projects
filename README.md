#1. Predicting Loan Payback Modle
##🎯 Business Problem
Loan lending is a core service provided by banks and financial institutions. However, not all borrowers repay their loans on time, which leads to financial losses. To reduce this risk, banks need a reliable system that can predict whether a customer is likely to repay a loan or default.

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that predicts loan payback behavior using customer financial and demographic data.

#2. 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Challenge
##🎯 Business Problem
Traditional diabetes diagnosis often happens after symptoms appear, which may be too late to prevent complications. Healthcare systems need a data-driven approach to:

-Identify high-risk individuals early

-Support preventive healthcare decisions

-Reduce long-term treatment costs

-Improve patient lifestyle awareness
