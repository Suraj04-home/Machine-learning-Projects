## 1️⃣ Predicting Loan Payback Model

### 🎯 Business Problem
Loan lending is a core service provided by banks and financial institutions. However, not all borrowers repay their loans on time, which leads to financial losses and increased risk.

To reduce this risk, banks require a reliable system that can **predict whether a customer is likely to repay a loan or default** before approving the loan.

### 🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning model** that predicts loan payback behavior using customer **financial and demographic data**. The model helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions and minimize default risk.

## 2️⃣ 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Challenge

### 🎯 Business Problem
Traditional diabetes diagnosis often occurs **after symptoms appear**, which may be too late to prevent serious health complications. Healthcare systems need a **proactive, data-driven approach** to improve early detection and prevention.

Key challenges addressed:
- Identify high-risk individuals early  
- Support preventive healthcare decisions  
- Reduce long-term treatment costs  
- Improve patient lifestyle awareness  

### 🧠 Project Overview
This project uses **machine learning techniques** to predict whether an individual is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on **demographic, lifestyle, and medical data**. The goal is to support early risk screening and preventive healthcare planning.
